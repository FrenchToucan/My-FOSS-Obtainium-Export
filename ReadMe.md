This repo contains my ever-evolving Obtainium export. The main benefit to others is that I have included the regex to download the “correct” apk so no manual intervention is required when installing for the first time or when installing updates. Just download the obaintium-export.json file, open Obaintium > Import/Export (at the botton) > Obtainium Import > select the obtainium-export.json file.
